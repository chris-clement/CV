## Work Experience

**JP Morgan** (June 2015 to September 2015)  
_Summer Intern_

- Employed within the PnL reporting team for Equity Capital Markets.  Worked with a wide range of departments within Finance, gained strong technical skills in excel and other reporting software.

## Skills

#### Team Player and Cross Team Collaboration

- Throughout my 5 years of working I have worked in 5 completely separate teams. This has given me a real ability to work well with people across many different backgrounds, management styles and cultures. 

- I have worked on many cross-departmental projects. This has led me to gain skills in understanding not only what our own team needs are but the needs of the business as a whole and working towards that common goal. My success in this has allowed me to act as a department representative and even lead projects from a relatively junior level. 

- I have always had strong feedback on my ability to always be personable, polite and collaborative in my work relationships and see this as one of my key strengths.

#### Automating Processes

- I have always had an interest in looking at ways of improving how a team performs a process. I am always willing and determined to revisit, rework and improve processes where time savings can be made or the quality of output can be improved. 

- An example of where I showcased this was in relation to a weekly meeting we had at JP Morgan when I covered the Equities Exotics trading desk. This was a meeting between Finance, Risk and the Trading Desk to discuss the past weekâ€™s performance. Finance were in charge of bringing a report to this meeting to talk through the figures along with supporting graphs and tables. It would take 3 hours to put together, often on a Friday afternoon/evening.

- I created a Macro in excel which pulled together data from 5 separate daily files, summarised the values by the required indicator and automatically updated all relevant graphs and tables. 

- This resulted in the file taking just 45 mins to put together, the vast majority of which was putting together commentary. This saved the team hours each week and meant it could be worked on Monday morning if necessary.

#### Creating Efficiencies

- Challenging how a process is completed and looking for ineffiencies is a key skill of mine that has been utilised throughout my work. 
 
- This is most recently evidenced by my time at Eisler Capital where the Finance team were facing increased pressure due to the number of traders doubling in the year I was there. This meant double the amount of reporting was required and we needed to support twice the number of people whilst our own team did not expand. The process had to change.

- I did this by identifying bottlenecks in the process such as the data we were downloading was too granular. The automated reports had been created through some legacy tool which people did not understand and had been created by someone who had left the company. I spent time understanding the tool and filtering on the data before running the report rather than after. This saved us 2 hours each day and allowed us to report our numbers earlier than we could have previously.

- This resulted in us being able to handle a larger volume of data and therefore support more of the business in the same amount of time.
